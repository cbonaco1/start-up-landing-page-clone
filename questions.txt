what is the difference between committing through the command line, and making a new repository, and then pushing an existing repository?
I thought what we were committing to through the command line was the repository.


-the section that is supposed to have the 3 icons (internet, coffee, and gas pump)
setting the width to 33.333% didnt make it look nice, didnt seem like it was given 1/3 the space.
-some of the sections are slightly above/below one another
--> try no specified width/height

when to use > or just list classes in CSS
--can get by without using it
--only applies to direct children (first child thats it, not recursive)
